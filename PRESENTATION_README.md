## 🌟 Humanized Project Summary

Our system uses Tesseract’s LSTM neural network OCR engine, enhanced by a seven-step image processing pipeline—grayscale conversion, resolution boost, contrast, brightness, and sharpness adjustments, noise reduction, and edge enhancement. This combination helps us accurately extract text from certificates in formats like PDF, JPG, and PNG, and we provide confidence scores to assess the quality of each extraction.

For verification, we cross-check certificate details against official records, use smart pattern recognition to spot fraud, and apply statistical analysis to catch anomalies. This ensures users get instant and reliable verification results.

Administrators and verifiers work with a user-friendly dashboard to view real-time analytics, monitor fraud detection logs, process certificates in bulk, and maintain a complete audit trail for compliance.

Our fraud detection system automatically flags suspicious certificates, supports administrative reviews, and analyzes trends to help prevent future fraud. It also offers clear, confidence-based recommendations to guide decision-making.
